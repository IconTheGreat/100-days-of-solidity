# üìù MultiSig Wallet

This is a **simple MultiSig Wallet smart contract** written in Solidity.  
It allows **3 owners** to collectively manage funds and approve transactions.  
A transaction requires **2 approvals** before it can be executed.

‚úÖ **Submit Transaction**  
Any owner can propose a transaction specifying:
- The recipient address (`to`)
- The amount of Ether to send

‚úÖ **Approve Transaction**  
Owners can approve a pending transaction.  
Each owner can only approve once.

‚úÖ **Execute Transaction**  
Once **2 approvals** are collected, any owner can execute the transaction, transferring the funds.

‚úÖ **Receive Ether**  
The contract can receive Ether deposits.
