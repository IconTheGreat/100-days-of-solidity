# 100 Days of Solidity

Welcome to my **100 Days of Solidity** journey.

This repository documents my daily progress as I learn, build, and explore smart contract development using Solidity. Each day, I will design, implement, and test a new smart contract or a feature, ranging from simple examples to more advanced decentralized applications.

Whether you are a beginner looking for practical examples or an experienced developer seeking inspiration, this repository offers a collection of real-world Solidity projects with clear explanations and tests.

## About the Challenge

**100 Days of Solidity** is a commitment to:

- Write smart contracts every day for 100 consecutive days.
- Learn and apply Solidity best practices.
- Explore topics such as staking, NFTs, DeFi, governance, and security.
- Document lessons learned and improve testing skills using Foundry.

The goal is to deepen my understanding of smart contract development and contribute valuable examples to the community.

## Projects

Each project is organized by day inside the `src/` and `test/` directories. 

Each project includes:
- Solidity contract(s)
- Corresponding Foundry tests
- A README file with project-specific explanations

You can browse daily folders to see the code and test coverage.

| Day | Project Title           | Code Link                                      | Test Link                                        |
|-----|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | ETH Staking Contract     | [View Code](./src/Day_001/ETHStaking.sol)     | [Test](./test/Day_001/ETHStaking.t.sol)         |
| 2   | Auction House Contract              | [View Code](./src/Day_002/AuctionHouse.sol)    | [Test](./test/Day_002/AuctionHouse.t.sol)        |

## Technologies Used

This repository uses:

- **Solidity** – The smart contract programming language.
- **Foundry** – A fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts** – Standard, audited smart contract libraries.
- **Ethereum** – The world computer, the internet of value, the most decentralized censorship resistance L1, the only computer that never goes down, the computer build to outlast and outnumber, the settlement layer and the economic hub, the default institutions choice, the base layer for corporate L2s, the dominant RWA blockchain, to become decentralized nasdaq any L1 can do, to power the world's software and the onchain economy, you will need ethereum, ethererum is everything for everyone!
- **Git** – Version control.

## How to Use This Repository

If you are learning Solidity, you can:

- Clone the repository to explore individual examples.
- Read each day’s contract and test files to understand their logic.
- Run the tests locally to see how contracts behave.
- Use the code as a reference or starting point for your own projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the examples locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IconTheGreat/100-days-of-solidity.git
   cd 100-days-of-solidity

Install Foundry
If you don’t have Foundry installed:

``` bash 
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

Build the Contracts
```bash 
forge build 
```

Run the Tests
```bash 
forge test 
```
